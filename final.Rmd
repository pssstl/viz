I really liked this visuzalization. However, I felt like I wanted to know more, specifically in terms of the difference in gender within these categories. For this I suggest the plot that I added after your last plot. To make sure I am not messing up your data names I named the new dataset that I created the get the count by gender OH0 (I just used my initials and added 0 in case I need to create another dataset as I move forward in the review). I hope that you will like this new suggestion.

I like this visualization. Somehow it did not look the same when I knit on my computer but it looks great on your Pdf.

I think all the figures show important data about how people perceive the SKY program. However, I don't think having an axis of participants initials gives useful information. I found myself counting how many people responded strongly agree versus strongly disagree which makes me think that a bar chart showing the number of responses for each category would give better information. I also think you can gather all the figures in one figure giving each question a different color to make it easily distinguishibale. 

You can use the follwing command for that:
ggarrange(Fig3.1, Fig3.2,...  , Fig3.10,
          ncol = 5, nrow = 5)
          
That said, given that have 10 figures, that might be a bit tricky and make a figure that is too crowded. For that, you can either divide it into two or three categories of questions or you can romove the part of the scale that is always equal to 0 (0, 1, and 2). Then, you can add a caption explaining that none of the respondents has responded that they disagree with any of the questions.

I like this one a lot. You mgiht add a wordcloud too. Just for fun :)

I have never heard of the SKY program before. It is really cool and I am glad I learned about it.
